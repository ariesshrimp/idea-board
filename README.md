# Idea Board
A running list of project ideas that interest me.


## Integration Services
- [ ] A Slack integration that encrypts messages between two people using the service. Maybe it intercepts the unecrypted slack message, stores it on an encrypted server, and then sends a key pair to the other person instead?  


## CLI / Developer Tools  
- [ ] A new github project generator that will set up the repo and bootstrap the boring files (test dir, travis config, package.json, index.html, etc). Configurable by project type / language environment.  
- [ ] A new macbook setup script that grabs all the languages / packages I like to use, installs them, and clones my configuration files.  


## Desktop / Native Apps
- [ ] A desktop notification system for new pets at the humane society.  
- [ ] A better app for tracking the long-term health of your pets (weight, illness, diet, medication, notes, etc.)  


## IoT
- [ ] An unltrasonic rat voice detector that sends SMS messages corresponding to the frequency (angry, happy, pained, etc).  
- [ ] A button that grabs the nearest car2go if it conforms to certain user settings.  
- [ ] Update Overmatch to be extensible without AWS updates, by incorporating Firebase  


## Web
- [ ] The game of Chess in Elm  
- [ ] The browserQuest game in Elm  
- [ ] A pokemon red clone in native browser API's  
- [ ] A IFTTT suite for serializing my social media info for my own consumption (their API's are mostly real bad).  
- [ ] A React based CMS  
- [ ] A mock / dummy Overwatch API  
- [ ] A spooky themed Hellboy encyclopedia  
- [ ] A rat diet planner


## Virtual / Augmented Reality  
- [ ] A picture taking game (like Pokemon Snap)


## Generic Technologies (no firm idea yet)
- [ ] Preact  
- [ ] Haskell  
- [ ] Elixir / Phoenix  
- [ ] WebGL  
- [ ] VR  
- [ ] JavaScript Generators  
- [ ] JS Proxies  
- [ ] Docker
