# Idea Board
A running list of project ideas that interest me.


## Integration Services
+ A Slack integration that encrypts messages between two people using the service. Maybe it intercepts the unecrypted slack message, stores it on an encrypted server, and then sends a key pair to the other person instead?  


## Desktop / Native Apps
+ A desktop notification system for new pets at the humane society.  
+ A better app for tracking the long-term health of your pets (weight, illness, diet, medication, notes, etc.)  


## IoT
+ An unltrasonic rat voice detector that sends SMS messages corresponding to the frequency (angry, happy, pained, etc).  
+ A button that grabs the nearest car2go if it conforms to certain user settings.  
+ Update Overmatch to be extensible without AWS updates, by incorporating Firebase  


## Web
+ The game of Chess in Elm  
+ The browserQuest game in Elm  
+ A pokemon red clone in native browser API's  
+ A IFTTT suite for serializing my social media info for my own consumption (their API's are mostly real bad).
